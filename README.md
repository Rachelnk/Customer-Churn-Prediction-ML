## Methodology:
1.Clean and prepare data for analysis using Pandas:
   - Removing unnecessary columns that are not required for modelling i.e. Customer ID.
   - Check for missing values in the dataset.
   - Replace missing values in the TotalCharges column with 0.
   - Class imbalance identified in the target column churn.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis:
   - Understand the distribution of the numerical features i.e. Tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges.
   - Create a correlation heatmap for numerical features(columns).
   - Create count plot for categorical columns.
3. Data preprocessing
